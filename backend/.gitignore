# Build output
dist/nt .env to get into github, so what should i write in my .gitignor

...
I'll help you add the .env file to your .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked by Git. I'll edit the .gitignore file in your backend directory.
I'll edit the file to include .env and some other common files that should typically be ignored in a backend project:

build/

# IDE and editor files
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
